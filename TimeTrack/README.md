# TimeTrack

If you need a simpler, efficient way of logging time if your work environment requires it.

##Roadmap##
* Current:
 * Command line application to track time on multiple work items/time codes using a simple, intuitive set of commands
 * Persist to sqlite database
 * Global hotkeys to enable quick logging

* Someday:
 * Intuitive and unobtrusive UI and menu
 * Tray icon and menu
 * Integration into different time tracking/project management software to automatically submit/log time to the system
 * Detect, interact/react on system events such as log on/log off etc. to increase accuracy and minimize inaccuracies if you forget to stop tracking
 * Run as a service

* Future fork ideas:
 * Port to cross platform
 * Port to could based system
