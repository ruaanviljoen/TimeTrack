# TimeTrack

Born out of a need for simple, less time consuming way of logging time if your work environment requires it.

##Roadmap##
* Current:
 * Command line application to log time to sqlite database with simple subset of commands
 * Global hotkeys

* Someday:
 * UI and menu
 * Tray icon and menu
 * Integration into different time tracking/project management software

* Future fork ideas:
 * Port to cross platform
